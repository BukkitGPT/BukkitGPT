## Introduction
> Give GPT your idea, AI generates customized Minecraft server plugins with one click, which is suitable for Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, Purpur, Arclight, CatServer, Magma, Mohist and other Bukkit-based servers.

BukkitGPT is an open source, free, AI-powered Minecraft Bukkit plugin generator. It was developed for minecraft server owners who are not technically savvy but need to implement all kinds of customized small plugins. From code to build, debug, all done by gpt.

## How it works
When the user types the plugin description, the program lets `gpt-3.5-turbo` optimize the prompt, and then gives the optimized prompt to `gpt-4`. `gpt-4` will return it in json format, for example:
```
{
    "output": [
        {
            "file": "%WORKING_PATH%/Main.java",
            "code": "package ...;\nimport org.bukkit.Bukkit;\npublic class Main extends JavaPlugin implements CommandExecutor {\n..."
        },
        {
            "file": "src/main/resources/plugin.yml",
            "code": "name: ...\nversion: ...\n..."
        },
        {
            "file\": "src/main/resources/config.yml",
            "code\": "..."
        },
        {
            "file": "pom.xml",
            "code": "..."
        }
    ]
}
```
The program parses this prompt, copies the entire `projects/template` folder and names it `artifact_name`, and puts the code from the prompt into the each file. Finally the program builds the jar using maven.

## Requirements
You can use BukkitGPT on any computer with [Java](https://www.azul.com/downloads/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/).  

And you need to install this package:
```
pip install openai
```

## Quick Start

*(Make sure you have the [Python](https://www.python.org) environment installed on your computer)*

### Console
1. Download `Source Code.zip` from [the release page]([https:///](https://github.com/Zhou-Shilin/BukkitGPT/releases)) and unzip it.
2. Edit `config.py`, fill in your OpenAI Apikey. If you don't know how, remember that [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) are always your best friends.
3. Run `console.py` (bash `python console.py`), enter the artifact name & description & package id as instructed to generate your plugin.
4. Copy your plugin from `projects/<artifact_name>/target/<artifact_name>-<version>.jar` to your server `plugins/` folder.
5. Restart your server and enjoy your AI-powered-plugin.

### UI

1. Download `Source Code.zip` from [the release page]([https:///](https://github.com/Zhou-Shilin/BukkitGPT/releases)) and unzip it.
2. Run `ui.py` (bash `python console.py`), go to Settings page and fill in your apikey. 
3. Enter the artifact name & description & package id as instructed to generate your plugin.
4. Copy your plugin from `projects/<artifact_name>/target/<artifact_name>-<version>.jar` to your server `plugins/` folder.
5. Restart your server and enjoy your AI-powered-plugin.

## Troubleshooting

### The POM for org.spigotmc:spigot:jar:1.13.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT is missing
Solution: [Download BuildTools](https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar), place it in an empty folder, double-click it, choose "1.13.2" in `Settings/Select Version`, click `Compile` in the bottom right corner and let it finish. And then go to your BukkitGPT folder, in `projects/<artifact_name_of_your_plugin>`, double-click `build.bat`. You'll find your plugin in `projects/<artifact_name_of_your_plugin>/target` folder.
